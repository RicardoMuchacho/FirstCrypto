# ERC20 Tokens - 1CRYPTO and RMCrypto

## Overview
First Crypto (1CRYPTO) is an ERC20 token created and deployed using the **Remix Web IDE**. The token has been successfully deployed on the **Sepolia Ethereum Testnet** and can be explored using the contract address provided below.

RMCrypto (RM) is an ERC20 token created for the purpose of testing and experimenting with key functionalities provided by the OpenZeppelin library. The contract includes the following features:

Ownable: Allows only the contract owner to perform certain privileged actions.
Mintable: Allows the owner to mint new tokens as needed.
Burnable: Allows the owner to burn (destroy) tokens from the contract.
Fixed Price Token Purchase: Users can buy tokens at a fixed price in Ethereum (ETH).

## Learning ERC20 & Solidity with OpenZeppelin
This project leverages the **OpenZeppelin ERC20 package**, a widely-used library for creating secure and compliant ERC20 tokens. By using OpenZeppelin's contract implementation, developers can learn:
- The **fundamentals of ERC20 token standards**.
- **Solidity best practices** for security and efficiency.
- How to extend ERC20 functionality using OpenZeppelin modules like **Ownable**, **Pausable**, and **Burnable**.
- How to integrate **OpenZeppelin Contracts** into real-world token projects.

To explore and experiment with OpenZeppelin's ERC20 contract, check out the official documentation:
